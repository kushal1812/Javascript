push()
    push adds an element to the last of an array

pop()
    deletes an element at the last of an array

shift()
    deletes an element at the first of an array


unshift()
    adds an element at the first of an array

splice()
    allows us to add or delete elements from middle of an array .

splice(1,1)
    meaning it goes to the index 1 element and removes the 1 element from there
splice(1,2)
    meaning it goes to the index 1 element and removes the 2 elements from there

to add through splice(1,0,'added through splice')
    meaning it adds the message at index 1.

splice(1,1,'addedededed)
    meaning it goes to index 1 and remove 1 element from  there and adds the message at that posittion


-----------------
LOOPING OVER ARRAYS
 forEach()      
    forEach() takes an argument 
    the difference is that we are going to pass function as an argument 
    When we do this the function we define and pass into other function 
    is known as call back function .

    In this case of forEach , callback function gets called one time for each item  
    in the array 
for()
    if you want to run a loop for a spcefic number of timens then we can go with 
    for() loop
--------------------------
SEARCHING AN ARRAYS
indexOf()
    indexOf method allows us to get the poition of an item in the array.
    if the item exists its index will be returned ,if not -1 will be returned .


    const places = ['Philadelphia', 'Texas', 'Vermont']
    const index = places.indexOf('Vermont')
    console.log(index)//will print 2 .

    Remember this doesnot work for arrayOfIndex() .
    indexOf() uses === method to compare the values .('Test' === 'Test is true).
    ({}==={} is false).

findIndex()
    method returns the index of the first element in the array that 
    satisfies the provided testing function. 
    Otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that no element passed the test.

find() 
    this method is similar to findIndex() ,
    findIndex method returns index 
    whereas find method returns the value itself .

------------------------

FILTERING AN ARRAYS
filter()
    filter method allows us to filter an array ,it returns a new 
    array with just filtered items .
---------------
sort() 
    sort method allows you to sort an array based on certain criteria

    sort(function(a,b))
        // if a should come firstreturn -1,
        // else
        // if b should come first return 1
